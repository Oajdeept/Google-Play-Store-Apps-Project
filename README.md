# Google-Play-Store-Apps-Project
## Context
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market!

## Data Features
Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, price, genres, and more.

## Content
This Github repository contains two Python notebooks. 
[Google Play Store Apps - Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/baolingz/Google-Play-Store-Apps-Project/blob/master/google-play-store-apps-data-pre-processing.ipynb), 
[Google Play Store Apps - EDA](https://github.com/baolingz/Google-Play-Store-Apps-Project/blob/master/google-play-store-apps-eda.ipynb)
In the first notebook, I removed irrelevant columns and outliers. Besides, I filled missing value using mean imputation technique.  
I have broken down all Google Play Store apps by Category and drawn boxplot charts to generate insights regarding their ratings, sizes, prices, number of reviews and downloads and etc. Besides, I also conducted correlation analysis between all parameters for 32 categories, including family, game, business, medical and etc. Comments was added under each charts and key takeaways can be seen at the end of the page.
